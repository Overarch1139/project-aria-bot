# Maintainership Status
Maintainership will conclude at the end of this year (Dec 31) at that point this project will be archived.
Thank you to everyone utilising Aria Bot and encouraging the development of the bot. Feel free to fork or make use of the code in this project, as it can easily be modified to verify different institutions that utilise GSuite Business/Education. 

# Project Purpose
Originally this bot was designed to verify whether a discord user is a student via the attest feature, but it expanded to be a more general purpose bot after the realisation that there were more features that could be added which weren't offered by existing bots like relaying Monash University news and COVID figures directly from the Victorian Department of Health.

# What does ARIA stand for?
ARIA is actually an abbreviation for the following:
- (A)dministrate - Provide administrative tools for server
- (R)elay - Relay useful information for users on the server
- (I)dentify - The status of users
- (A)ttest - Verify whether a given user is a Monash University Student
